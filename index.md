I am a professor and researcher at the University of Brasília. My work focuses on political communication, public communication, and misinformation in media environments, with particular attention to public interest issues such as health and public policy. I use empirical and experimental methods to study how communication strategies shape information exposure and public debate. I am particularly motivated by applied research that produces actionable knowledge to inform public and individual decision-making, contributing to a world that is healthier, safer, and more equitable. I have recently published in Political Behavior and Vaccine and was a visiting researcher at Université Laval in Quebec, Canada, in 2024–2025.
