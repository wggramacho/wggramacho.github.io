I am a professor and researcher at the University of Brasília. My work focuses on political communication, public communication, and misinformation in media environments, with particular attention to public interest issues such as health and public policy. I use empirical and experimental methods to examine how communication strategies shape information exposure and public debate.
My current projects examine misinformation on public interest issues such as health, public security, and public policy, with a focus on empirically evaluating communication strategies designed to reduce the spread of misleading information. Recent articles were published in Political Behavior, Vaccine, and Revista Latino-Americana de Opinión Pública (RLOP). In 2024–2025, I was a visiting researcher at Université Laval in Quebec (Canada).
